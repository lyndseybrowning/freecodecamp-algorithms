# Confirm the Ending

Check if a provided string ends with the provided target.

Challenge note:

**This challenge can be solved with the .endsWith() method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.**

Example:

```javascript
confirmEnding('Lyndsey', 'y'); // => true
```
